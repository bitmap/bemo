#Bemo

**Bemo** is a minimalist CSS boilerplate. It's designed to be lightweight and unobtrusive.

Install **Bemo** with Bower:
```
$ bower install bemo --save
```

##What is this
**Bemo** isn't a heavy framework, and it isn't designed to replace your site's CSS. **Bemo** is designed to be used on common elements such as buttons and tables. There are a few neat features thrown in like a menu bar, a basic grid, and some utility classes as well.

**Bemo** was built with OOCSS philosophy in mind and leverages some of it's style from BEM methodology. It's completely agnostic and can be used on top of resets like Normalize.

##Build
**Bemo** is written in Myth and built using Gulp. You'll need Node.js/npm to build from source.

```
$ git clone git@github.com:cabebr/bemo.git
$ cd bemo
$ npm install
$ gulp
```
Run `gulp watch` to compile changes in `src`. Check out the `gulpfile.js` for more dev stuff.
